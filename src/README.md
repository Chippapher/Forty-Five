# Forty-Five

## overview

Forty-Five is a card game in which the object of the game is to reach 45 points first by way of winning "tricks" or
or "lifts".

The full official rules can be found [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/forty-five/) however the game logic 
implemented here is a local variant of these rules, variations including: if the dealer
flips an Ace as trump, they are given the opportunity to rob, and, if a player declines to rob, the dealer is not given
 the opportunity to rob.
